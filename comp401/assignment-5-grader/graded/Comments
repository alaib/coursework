Assignment 5 grades have been released on Sakai. Please find the details of grading, resubmission and comments below:-

Grading Criteria
==================
Timely Submission
==================
Total Number of tests = 25
Points for every test passed = 1
Style Points = 5 (3 -> code readability, 2 -> no repetitive code)
Max Points = 25 * 1 + 5 = 30 points

Final Score = round(pointsScored/3)
Max Final Score = round(30/3) = 10

Late submission or Resubmission
================================
Total Number of tests = 25
Points for every test passed = 0.6 
Style Points = 5 (3 -> code readability, 2 -> no repetitive code)
Max Points = 25 * 0.6 + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20 points

Final Score = round(pointsScored/3)
Max Final Score = round(20/3) = 7

Resubmission Comments
=====================
1) If you have scored less than 7, you can resubmit and score max resubmission points i.e., 7. If you still scored 10, take a look at my comments which might help you to program better. If your code is failing 1-5 tests, please fix it, as you will use much of the same code for Assignment 6.
2) Please send me an email ( ravikirn@cs.unc.edu ) with the subject "Assignment 5 Resubmission - <Your Name>" if you resubmit on Sakai.

General Comments
=================
1) Lot of repetitive code - Please avoid lengthy repetitive code, it's not only cumbersome but also diminishes readability
2) Push common functionality into the parent class, than rewriting it in every subclass.
3) Cache result of function calls into local variables. I have not considered this in grading criteria. Many of you didn't cache getPosition(), getGame(), getGame().getBoard().
Just to give you an example of why this is important, I have created a jsperf (Javascript) test where I run a loop over an array of length 10^6 with and without caching arrayLength. Unless, it's optimized internally (e.g., Chrome), it will hamper the speed of your program. 
JSPERF Test URL -> http://jsperf.com/comparing-loops-with-and-without-caching-array-length
(Interpreting results: higher the better)

Specific
=========
Ahn, Kihoon - everything done in parent class instead of subclass
Cavell, Stephen (cavell) - Late submission (Mar 31, 2013 12:08 pm)
